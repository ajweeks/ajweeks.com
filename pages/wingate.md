## Wingate

- C++, UE4

##### *Coming early 2018!*

Wingate is a rogue-like-inspired real-time-strategy game. You command a small army of units through a 1920's era city in search for *luma* - the city's most valuable natural resource. The substance has been used for years as a power source, but recently a variant of it was discovered that, when consumed, gives you super-human speed. Use your specialist units strategically to break down those who stand in your way, while your regular units blast through them in hoards.

My responsibilities were mainly in the areas of the user interface, camera, and unit selection.
