## Swing Bolt
###### 2017

- Unity, C#

Swing Bolt is a fast-paced single-player arcade game which I made for the 48 hour Ludum Dare 39 game jam. In Swing Bolt you control a metallic sphere who is constantly running out of power. In order to stay alive you need to collect the randomly spawning batteries. You also have to watch out for the bombs which drop from over head since they will drain your power even faster if you're nearby when they explode! As the game progresses more and more blue spheres appear, making movement around the arena tougher and tougher.
