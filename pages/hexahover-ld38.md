## HexaHover

- Unity, C#

Local-multiplayer hovercraft bumper car party game!

This is game I made with two friends as an entry into the 72-hour [Ludum Dare 38](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/) game jam competition.

The aim of the game is to bump the other players off the playing field and be the last one standing. As time goes on, the ground tiles fall away, making it tougher and tougher to stay alive.

Play the game here: [solarbear.itch.io/hexahover](https://solarbear.itch.io/hexahover)
