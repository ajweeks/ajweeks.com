## Internship at Electric Square
###### *February - June 2018*

- C++, Unreal Engine 4

During my four month internship at [Electric Square](https://www.electricsquare.com/) I worked as a game programmer on an undisclosed project. My responsibilities included fixing bugs, working on low-level systems, and improving various systems. **This page will be updated once more info about the game is made public.**

Apart from all of the technical lessons I learned during my internship I also learned many useful team skills which noticeably improved my productivity as the internship went on. After completing my internship I was offered a full-time role, which I accepted.
