## Crowchild (Apex Engine)
###### 2016

- C++, SFML, Box2D

> This project was discontinued in late 2016.

Crowchild is the code name for a game I began making using my custom-built "Apex Engine". It is my first 2D game engine written using C++. It supports some basic game functionality and utilizes Box2D for physics and SFML for window creation and input management. School got in the way of me continuing this project further, and then I began working on a new 3D engine once I had some free time again.

### Notable features
 - Debug user-interface overlay (color editor, drop downs, buttons, sliders)
 - Dynamically-sized 9-slice sprite rendering
 - Barebones character dialogue system
 - Real-time light editor (position, radius, colour, falloff)
 - Custom keybindings (editable via pause menu)
