## Apex Engine

- C++, SFML, Box2D

> This project was discontinued in late 2016.

Apex Engine is my first personal 2D game engine, written using C++. It supports some basic game functionality and utilizes Box2D for physics and SFML for window creation and input management.

I began adding features that could be used in an RPG-like game, and decided to call the game Crowchild. It never became more than the simple prototype you can see here.

### Notable features
 - Custom debug overlay / UI (color editor, drop downs, buttons, sliders)
 - Dynamic text box (using 9-slice sprite rendering)
- Character dialogue system
 - Real-time light editor (position, radius, falloff)
 - Custom keybindings (editable via pause menu)

You can find project's source on my GitHub here: [github.com/ajweeks/ApexEngine/](https://github.com/ajweeks/ApexEngine/) <br /><span style="font-size: 12px">(But I don't recommend using it as a guide since it was my first personal engine)</span>
