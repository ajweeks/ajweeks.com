## Unreal Tournament 4 Level

##### Unreal Tournament 4, 3Ds Max, Photoshop

This is my first ever level, made in Unreal Engine 4. I spent about 3 months making it in its entirety, all modeling, texturing, material creation, and layout designing was done by myself in that time. It was designed to work best for 2-3 players in free for all type death matches.

A modular approach was taken to reduce the amount of time needed to fill out the entire level, as well as instacing of one main material with many parameters.
