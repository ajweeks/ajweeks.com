        This is high poly model of the 1980 Fiat 131 Mirafiori.
        <br />
        I spent about two months working on this model. It was by far the biggest 3D project I've attempted.
        This model has just over 1 250 000 polygons when using two iterations of turbosmooth.
        The majority of the material work was done in 3Ds Max with some additional texture preparation done in Adobe Photoshop.
