Perhaps contrary to what you might expect this post to be about based on the title (that everything is a remix, or that nothing is original), it's about something else entirely. Although for the record, I do believe that anything creative is strongly influenced by other things.

When I stumble upon something interesting, I'm the kind of person who will research that thing, often looking to find out more about the creator, and the process in which that thing was created.

Most recently I've done this with Tom Francis, most notably known for making [Gunpoint](http://www.gunpointgame.com/) (The game which knocked me into this never-ending rabbit hole). He has quite a lot of content on [his website](http://www.pentadact.com/) and [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Pentadact). I always find so much inspiration when watching devlogs of cool games made by very small teams, I suppose mostly because I can see myself in their shoes and that is something I very much see myself doing in the somewhat near future.

The point I wanted to make with this post is, sometimes I feel strongly like copying certain elements from successful people, usually in very small ways, like using the same tools they use, or publishing blog posts similarly formatted to theirs. I think any kind of creativity requires some of this copying, but I also think it's vital that you add something, not only for copyright reasons, but also because if you don't, then what's the point in making it? (Other than improving your skills of course).

In this case, I saw that Tom uses WordPress to write his [blog](http://www.pentadact.com/) (which I'd highly recommend reading by the way, it's endlessly interesting). After seeing this, some part of me felt an urgent desire to just entirely switch my website back to WP (yet again). I stopped myself from doing this (thankfully I think), but it made me think about just how influential role models can be.
