This is my first blog post using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)! I first heard about jekyll around a year ago, but I was afraid to dive into using it as it seemed a bit daunting. Although now I can say with certainty that I'm quite glad I did. It wasn't *too* bad to install, even on Windows which it doesn't technically support. I've wanted a way to blog for a long time now, but up until now I hadn't found anything that wasn't overly restrictive (I'm looking at you Wordpress), and also wasn't super complicated. Jekyll seems to be a really good middle ground. You have to be comfortable with a command line interface, but at the same time you don't need to know how to program asm.

The reason I decided to learn jeykll was mostly since I just purchased a domain name, [ajweeks.com](http://ajweeks.com), since my old URL was a bit unprofessional (ajweeks.github.io). Hopefully I'll continue to be pleasantly surprised with this service and therefore be encouraged to post on here often. It definitely makes web development a whole lot easier.

That's all for now, thanks for reading!
