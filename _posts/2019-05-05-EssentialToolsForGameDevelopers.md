This is an ongoing list of things I find really useful. If you have any that you couldn't live without that aren't here, let me know on twitter [@liqwidice](https://twitter.com/liqwidice)

### Tools
General programmers:
- [Listary](https://www.listary.com/) - for finding any file or folder on your system almost instantly [free]
- [Visual Assist](https://www.wholetomato.com/) - for various useful code searching/editing features in VS
- [clink](https://github.com/mridgers/clink) - adds some nice to have features to shell (cmd)
- [Manic Time](https://www.manictime.com/) - time tracking software

Graphics-specific:
- [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) - for debugging anything graphical
- [Nvidia Nsight](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-visual-studio-edition) - for debugging anything graphical when RenderDoc isn't working
- [Visual Studio Graphics Debugging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/graphics/visual-studio-graphics-diagnostics?view=vs-2019) - for debugging anything graphical when Nsight isn't working either
