I recently published the course notes I created for a workshop I gave at [work](https://electricsquare.com) here: [github.com/ElectricSquare/RaymarchingWorkshop](https://github.com/ElectricSquare/RaymarchingWorkshop). The workshop takes you through the theory and application of raymarching, an alternative rendering technique to rasterization. By the end you will have your very own raymarcher which can produce images like the one shown below! No prior graphics programming experience is required, nor is any software besides a web browser!

So if you're interested in learning about graphics programming, take a look and share what you make!
