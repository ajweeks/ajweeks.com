As you may or may not know, Christer “McFunkypants” Kaitila, the creator of <a class="underline" href="http://www.onegameamonth.com">One Game a Month</a> attempted to (and succeeded in) finishing 12 games in 2012, among various other goals. He has written several blog posts about it, including one about <a class="underline" href="http://mcfunkypants.com/2012/quest/">his original goal</a>, <a class="underline" href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/1gam-how-to-succeed-at-making-one-game-a-month--gamedev-3695">how you can do it</a>, and <a class="underline" href="http://mcfunkypants.com/2012/12-games-in-12-months/">how it went for him</a>.

The idea of completing 12 games in 12 months is a bit daunting, but it also sounds like a great challenge to me as a developer. Today is the first day of February, I’ve already lost an entire month! Where did it go? Thankfully, I completed a game earlier this month (which you can find <a class="underline" href="https://ajweeks.com/games/pong">here</a>), and the goal is to finish 12 games in the year, no matter when you started them, so that’s 1 done out of 12. I have a few (and by a few I mean several dozen) other games which I’ve started, so I think I should take advantage of that and attempt to finish them up to get closer to my goal faster. Wish me luck! I’ll report back when I’ve finished my next game.
