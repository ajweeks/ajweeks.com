    <h2>Game of Life</h2>
    <h6>2014</h6>

    <p>This is a clone of John Conway&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>,
         made in java from scratch.</p>

    <p>This is a very basic implementation, with its features including: the ability to play and
        pause the simulation, control the speed of the simulation, and a few presets of interesting patterns.
        Trying to avoid swing, I implemented my own buttons, and rendered the entire game using java.awt.</p>

    <p>This was a school project for Computer Science 20 made in around a month of in-school time. Overall
        Iâ€™m pretty proud of how it turned out, given the short time frame, and my limited knowledge at the time.</p>
