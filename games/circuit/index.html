    <h2>Circuit Simulator</h2>

    <p>This is a simple electronic circuit simulator that I made in pure Java from scratch.</p>

    <p>The simulator features three types of components: wires, inverters, and power sources.
        Wires and power sources connect to any neighbor that they can, while inverters only connect to
        their neighbors which are directly in front of and behind them.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve implemented saving and loading of the grid, various keyboard shortcuts, and a helpful
        <span title="(F3)" style="color: #CCC; cursor: copy">debug mode</span>. I wanted to avoid using swing entirely, for various reasons, and
        therefore implemented the buttons completely from scratch, rendering everything using
        Java's Abstract Windowing Toolkit.</p>

    <p>This was a school project for Computer Science 20 and took around one month of in-school work.</p>
