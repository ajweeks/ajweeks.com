    <p>This is a clone of one of the first video games ever made: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a>.</p>

    <p>I implemented three game modes; single-player with three difficulties of AI, two-player local,
        and two-player networked (multiplayer). The multiplayer is really horribly done and almost too
        laggy to even be playable, but it does work once you clear a specified port in your router settings.
        As usual, I wanted steer clear of swing, and therefore created my own button class, with the ability
        to use either a coloured background, or an image.</p>

        <p>This was just a personal project, which I worked on over the span of several months.
            Overall Iâ€™m pleased with the way it turned out, and other than the horrid state the networking is in,
            I feel this game is finished.</p>
